## What we will implement:
A desktop calculator implemented using C# \
You will be able to enter numbers and operations using keyboard input or by clicking on buttons in the GUI using the cursor. If you have entered a legitimate expression to be calculated, its answer will show up. \
We will design it using the model-view-controller pattern. \
The languages we are going to use are:
- C# 
- XAML

### Features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentiation operations
